            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4 text-pink-400">Should We Run It Back?</h2>
            <div class="prose-custom max-w-none space-y-4">
                <p>You remember the OpenPact experiment. The one where I algorithmically tried to find people friendships. The numbers were solid: <strong>118 participants</strong>, <strong>59 friendships</strong>, all powered by <strong>1 glorious algorithm</strong>. There's been a strong demand to resurrect this digital cupid for Prom Night, this time in romantic mode with full LGB support.</p>
                <p>But let's be real. The stakes are higher. This isn't about finding a buddy to complain about assignments with. This is <span class="font-bold text-lg italic">PROM</span>. The algorithm is good(it is Gale Sharply, so it did get a Nobel prize), but is it "perfect prom date" good? What if it pairs you with your mortal enemy? (Ryan Hota cough, cough) What if your perfect match is... nobody? (With the ratio in this campus, it is a possibility) What if it pairs a die-hard MI fan with a Dhoni stan? (Yes, Mandar, we remember).</p>
                <p class="font-bold text-xl text-center text-yellow-300 py-4">This brings us to a crucial point: my physical well-being.</p>
                <p>I am more than willing to unleash the algorithm for the good of the student body. However, I have a deep-seated fear of being chased by a pitchfork-wielding mob. </p> <p>So, before we proceed, we need to come to an understanding.</p>

                        <p>I did not know Malay before this, and we got in touch. We both realized we shared a lot of similarities, and I think we are good friends now. So, kudos to the algorithm.</p>
                        <p>But honestly, we didn't really talk much after we were matched. I'm extremely introverted and avoid talking to strangers if I can. Your algorithm had matched us, but that didn't change the fact that he was still just a stranger. And Malay also did not seem to be pushing much. We had a couple of text exchanges, and we would nod to each other when we crossed, but we weren't really friends. I think the only reason we ended up becoming friends is because we were both a part of Vedant's Campaign.</p>
                        <p>All-in-all, I think the algorithm did a good job. It did find a potential good friend. Whether one would end up becoming friends with this person, I suppose, depends on a lot of other personal and practical Factors.</p>

We were on fire. after that i kind of reached out to him a few times, even invited to my bday; but alas he was too shy to respond to any of them. he seems like a talented guy but got stuck in a loop of non-interaction and spending all his time on the internet. I wish he improves after I leave.</p>
                        <p>maybe it would be nice to have questions that gauge the person's desire to socialize in a better. I know I matched 2nd with Gautham which would be pretty accurate. Thanks for the sick experiment.</p>

I further pledge, on my honour, that should I receive no match, or a match I deem... suboptimal, I will not engage in any acts of retribution, physical or otherwise, against the humble creator of this system. I will accept my fate with grace and dignity, and I will definitely, absolutely, 100% not beat them up.
